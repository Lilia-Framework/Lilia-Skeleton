# Lilia Skeleton Schema
 
Skeleton schema for [Lilia 1.0](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia)

## Getting Started

To begin using Skeleton Schema, navigate to the [core](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia-Skeleton-Schema/tree/main/schema/core) folder within the Schema Folder available at this link. Inside the core folder, you can find a collection of libraries that are included as part of the [schema](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia-Skeleton-Schema/tree/main/schema/).

To configure these libraries, make adjustments according to your specific project requirements and preferences. Customizing the settings will allow you to tailor the schema to your needs.

Once you have configured the libraries, you can proceed to configure the plugins and factions based on your desired functionality and features.

If you have any questions or need assistance with the schema, or if you would like to engage with the community, feel free to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RTcVq92HsH). You can find us at this Discord invite link. We are ready to help and support you in any way we can.
